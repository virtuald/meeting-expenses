meeting-expenses
================

A simple little project to allow you to calculate how much money your project
is wasting while people are yapping. 

Mostly a fun little experiment to learn more about using meteor. You can find
a live demo online at http://meeting-expenses.meteor.com .

This idea was inspired by conversations with various colleagues who probably
prefer to remain uncredited.

Afterwards, I found this (http://tobytripp.github.io/meeting-ticker/), which
was an additional source of inspiration.
